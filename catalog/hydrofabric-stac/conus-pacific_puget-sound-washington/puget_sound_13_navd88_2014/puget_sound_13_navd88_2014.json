These integrated bathymetric-topographic DEMs are used to support individual coastal States as part of the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program's (NTHMP) efforts to improve community preparedness and hazard mitigation. Bathymetric, topographic, and shoreline data used in DEM compilation are obtained from various sources including: NOAA; the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); the Puget Sound Lidar Consortium (PSLC); and other federal, state, and local government agencies, academic institutions, and private companies. DEMs are referenced to the vertical datum of NAVD 88 and horizontal datum of World Geodetic System 1984 geographic (WGS 84). Grid spacing for the DEM is 1/3 arc-second (~10 meters).",
